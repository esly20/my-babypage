    <h1>Who was Baby Emma Slibeck?</h1>

        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! Funny story: I have an older brother, and when he was born my Dad made him a <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jsli/bennett/">baby page</a>. Three years later when I was born there was no baby page for young Emma. Very sad, I know. So know after all these years, baby Emma will now have a web page.</p>

        <p>Baby Emma was quite fun. This was her at a whole 9 months, just before Christmas.</p>
